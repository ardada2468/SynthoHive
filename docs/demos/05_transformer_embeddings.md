# Transformer Embeddings Demo

Path: `examples/demos/05_transformer_embeddings`

## Goal
Show transformer-based embeddings and recovery of transformed features.

## Run
```bash
python examples/demos/05_transformer_embeddings/run.py
```

## Outputs
- `outputs/transformed.npy`
- `outputs/recovered.csv`

## Notes
- Highlights `DataTransformer` behavior with embedding thresholds.
- Useful for inspecting how categorical embeddings are produced and inverted.
